The first step to building this button-and-sidebar component is to break down the component into smaller pieces. Here are a few problems you may identify:

a)What is the markup of this button?
b)How should the button look?
c) What happens when the button gets clicked once?

d) What happens when the button gets clicked again?
Sidebar goes away
e) What happens when the button gets clicked a third time?
Sidebar shows up again
